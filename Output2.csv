Fig doesn't accept my login -- after I've logged in with my email, received a code and entered it, I get a Login Successful! output. However, no autocomplete pops up, and when I check fig doctor, my login seems to not have been properly stored as I get a response telling me that I am not logged in.
fig doctor output:

10,1610,Red artifact border(?) around fig popup menue,"Description:
Please include a detailed description of the issue (and an image or screen recording, if applicable)
On one of the three Macs on which I am running fig, there is what I think is a red border around the auto-complete menu (see attached screenshots). When the menu is not populated, it presents as a single vertical line. This happens in both terminal.app and the VSCode integrated terminal. I believe this happened after a recent update. I am guessing it's a config thing rather than a bug since it is only happening on one computer, and that it is related to Fig because it happens in two different programs (unless VSCode is just a window for terminal.app).
I have tried
restarting Fig
restarting the computer
renaming the ~/.fig folder
renaming the ~/Library/Preferences/com.mschrage.fig* folders
reinstalling Fig
None of these steps have resolved the problem. Any thoughts of where else to look would be appreciated.

15,1615,\b character ignored from custom insertValue commands using template literals,"Sanity checks
I have searched github.com/withfig/fig/issues and there are no duplicates of my issue
I have run fig doctor in the affected terminal session
I have typed 'git ' and included a screenshot of the Debugger (click the Fig icon in the macOS menu bar)
Issue Details
Description:
When creating personal shortcuts it is recommended to add two \b characters (backspace escape code) at the start of your insertValue command to remove the shortcut trigger from the actual command. \b characters are ignored if the insertValue command is passed a template literal ``
Example
Assuming a personal shortcut triggered by +[space]
{
      icon: ""fig://icon?type=github"",
      name: ""withfig/fig issues"",
      insertValue: ""\b\bopen https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues"",
      description: ""Open Fig Issues Github page""
}
The above works as expected the + typed to trigger the shortcuts is removed and open https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues is triggered as expected.
{
      name: ""Good Morning! ☀️"",
      icon: ""☀️"",
      description: ""Update brew, NPM and node. Say an inspirational quote"",
      insertValue: `\b\b
        brew update; 
        npm install npm@latest -g; 
        npm update -g;
        brew upgrade node;
        echo;
        npx -y fortuity | npx -y cowsay;
        echo;
      `
}
The above runs but before it starts it logs a command not found: + error.
Additional Thoughts
Because new lines trigger the previous command we could see some issues with any new lines before \b\b. e.g.
insertValue: `
  \b\b;
  brew update; 
  npm install npm@latest -g; 
  npm update -g;
  brew upgrade node;
  echo;
  npx -y fortuity | npx -y cowsay;
  echo;
`
would still trigger a command not found error because the enter signal would be sent before the backspace signals. Not exactly related but close enough any solution to this should probably keep that in mind.

20,1620,Fig defeats fish shell's Ctrl+F shortcut,"Description:
Please include a detailed description of the issue (and an image or screen recording, if applicable)
One of the most useful and frequently used keyboard shortcuts offered by all shells out-of-the-box is Ctrl+F, which is mapped to ""move cursor right"". In fish shell, this keyboard shortcut combines beautifully with fish's built-in auto-completion support to enable the user to easily accept fish's currently suggested auto-completion.[1]
However, after upgrading to the latest version of Fig, Fig has now taken over Ctrl+F in fish shell, so users can no longer use it to move the cursor right or accept fish's current auto-completion. Instead, Ctrl+F now trigger's Fig's ""Create new Workflow..."" UI. Here's a screenshot where you can see I had typed ""./u"", then fish suggested an auto-completion (""./upgrade-dev-dependencies.sh""), then I tried hitting Ctrl+F to accept that completion, but rather than working as expected, Fig instead took over my shell with its ""Create new Workflow"" UI (but somewhat confusingly, still left fish's suggested auto-completion visible):
I searched in Fig settings for any sign of a Ctrl+F keybinding I could hopefully disable, but couldn't find it there.
Could you please fix this in the next version of Fig? And in the meantime, is there any workaround to get Ctrl+F working in fish again with the current version of Fig? This bug is killing my productivity so much I might have to uninstall Fig until this is fixed, but I'm hoping it won't come to that.
Thanks for the great work on Fig!
[1] You can also use right arrow, but Ctrl+F is preferable for touch typists because there's no need to take hands away from the home row, especially when the Control key is in a convenient place, e.g. when Capslock is mapped to Control.
