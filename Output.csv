When Fig shows multiple options as I type a prefix, if I press Tab, the last prefix replaces the entire command. Pressing Enter replaces the entire command with the first option instead.
Steps to Reproduce:
This doesn't seem to happen everywhere, but here are few reproducible steps for me:
Tab:
Type cd /Us (note uppercase U), Fig shows autocomplete menu with options: Users and usr.
Press Tab.
Enter:
This time, type cd /us (lowercase u), Fig shows autocomplete menu with the same two options.
Press Enter.
Expected Results:
I'm not sure what Fig's default behavior is, but it should either do nothing (which is what happens if I typed a lowercase U in step 1), or it should select the first highlighted option and continue.
Actual Results:
Tab:
Fig replaces the entire line with just us, and the keybuffer has cd /us.
Autocomplete is still open with the same options btw.
Enter:
Fig replaces the entire line with just Users/, and the keybuffer has cd /Users/.

It's just going to make it a really solid solution to make fig integrates with PhpStorm internal terminal window
Describe the solution you'd like
PhpStorm is currently the top pick for PHP developers which offers many features (AIO) which for the most part allows you to do all within the IDE without the need to use external programs (ex: Git, Terminal, etc)
So if Fig is able work well with the IDE's internal terminal window. it will make a big difference.
Describe alternatives you've considered
The current alternative is to keep 2 windows open, one for the IDE and other for the terminal (iTerm2)
Additional context
I am not sure if this is the place for it, but the support for the IDE + composer + npm is a killer combo

Please include a detailed description of the issue (and an image or screen recording, if applicable)
Having trouble with Fig on cd command in sessions when I'm ssh'd into a remote machine. Other commands work fine, such as git and ls.
I have gotten Fig to work with cd on my remote machine, but it is intermittent when it will work for me. I normally one of the following states:
Fig box will say that it doesn't have context and I need to run fig source
In this case, I will exit the remote box, run fig source locally, then ssh back into the remote.
Fig box simply doesn't show up on remote machine
Fig box shows my local file structure
Fig box works as it should, showing remote file structure
In this case, it will only work on this single iTerm tab/window. If I open another tab/window and log into my remote box, it generally will not show a Fig box at all with cd.
I have had instances where git would not pull up a Fig window either, but that's generally solved by running fig source on my local then going back.
I've been talking with falky97 about this issue and he mentioned it could be an issue with my custom prompt, which uses https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.
I'm running Zsh with Oh-my-zsh locally and Zsh with Prezto on the remote machine, both using Powerlevel10K for the prompt. I'm going to try switching prompts and see if that effects anything and will remote back.

When opening a new Chrome tab and immediately typing, input is blocked for a second or two - it varies.
If I kill the Fig process the issue goes away, but it comes back again after restarting and triggering an autocomplete.
Reproduce:
Restart the Fig process.
Trigger the autocomplete in iTerm (by typing git for example)
Open a new tab in Chrome and try to start typing.
Best guess:
I wonder if there is some expensive blocking code in the Accessibility UI key logger hook, as this api is synchronous.

This basically made me disable the tool.

112,112,Keybindings don't use Apple's input source mapping (Colemak) (and editing doesn't work?),"Completion Spec
(NA: Fig itself)
Description
Context: I use Colemak, so some of my keys are moved around relative to Qwerty, and some are in the same place.
Issue: The keybindings don't map to keys from Apple's system, but rather directly from the keys themselves. So e.g. historySearchForward ^N doesn't use ^N but the N on my keyboard, which is actually K.
(Secondary: editing keybindings isn't changing anything, even after rebooting Fig and iTerm)
Steps to reproduce
Type something that produces a pop-up
Try ^N and have nothing happen
Try ^K and have the same behaviour as down-arrow
(secondary: edit keybindings file, have no changes occur even on reboot of Fig and iTerm)
Expected result
I expect that ^N enters the suggestions, as down-arrow does.
(secondary: I expect whatever I put in the keybindings file to work - and for what's not there not to)
Actual result
Nothing for ^N, works for ^K.
(secondary: old keybindings remain)
System Information
Fig Version: 1.0.42 (B207)
OS: Big Sur 11.3.1
Device: Apple M1 Macbook Pro
Potential Solution
I think other apps do use the system keys, even through accessibility, but I'm not sure what's required. I tried to solve using keybinding edits, but indeed that didn't yet work.
(for the keybindings, I'm not sure what's happening there)

I’ve just started using Fig on my computer and I’ve noticed that I lose Fig on git repo directories. My setup is a mac, iterm2, bash.
I’ve been able to pinpoint the issue around the git prompt I’m using (the one from git’s official repo). Here’s my bash_rc section for the prompt:
# Prompt
source $HOME/.git-prompt.sh
export PROMPT_DIRTRIM=3
GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1

If I comment out GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES, GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM, and GIT_PS1_SHOWCOLORHINTS, then Fig works on git repo directories.
Solution:
It looks like Fig thinks that git is the active process which is why it doesn’t show suggestions.

To fix, just restart Fig (◧ → Restart)
Why would this happen?
Fig listens for changes to your Fig settings file and then automatically makes them available to Fig apps like autocomplete without restarting the app. This is the same as VSCode. However, if the listener is broken or starts listening before the file is created, it may not work.
We aren’t 100% sure if this is the reason, however, it seems most likely 😃
If this happens to you and restarting doesn’t fix it, comment below and we’ll look into it 🕵️‍♀️ 🔎

146,146,No Title Found,"Problem:
When creating a spec, how can I have an option ‘–’ and then interpret everything after as a new command? For example, aws-vault is a tool to manage aws keys. A command might be aws-vault exec <myprofilename> —- sls deploy, which would run the serverless framework deploy command with the keys for aws in the environment.
Solution:
Create an option called --. it should take one arg. The arg object should have the isCommand: true prop.
For example:
var roles = {
  script: ""aws-vault list --profiles"",
  splitOn: ""\n"",
};
var completionSpec = {
  name: ""aws-vault"",
  description: ""AWS Keys manager from 99 Designs"",
  subcommands: [
    {
      name: ""exec"",
      description: ""execute a command with AWS creds in the environment"",

In order to update the title of the terminal emulator, Fig writes to ANSI escape codes directly to the corresponding /dev/tty file descriptor. This triggers fish to redraw the prompt when it shouldn’t.

It is possible you have hub aliased to git.
Fig is aware of aliases**, so although there is an existing completion spec for git, since one doesn’t exist for hub, completions will not appear.
How to check if a shell alias exists?
You can check if you have an alias set up by running which git.
If you haven’t aliased it, the output should look like this:
/usr/bin/git

The Debugger
Fig has a a debugger built into its dropdown menu. It’s pretty fleshed out so if something is going wrong, it will direct you how to fix it.
Note: Make sure to click on your terminal first, then click the ◧ icon for it to work.
All of the issues the debugger is aware of and their solutions can be found here: https://withfig.com/docs/support/errors
Some other things that could be going on
Your terminal isn’t supported:
Fig currently only works on macOS in the following terminals: native macOS terminal, iTerm2.
Fig also works in the following terminals provided you install the relevant integrations in ◧ > Settings: VSCode’s inbuilt terminal, Hyper
Your terminal is too pimped:
You may have a custom shell, theme, or plugin (that you built yourself or through a framework like ohmyzsh) that Fig doesn’t support. If so email or Slack us
We should work with most ohmyzsh configs and the debugger should capture things that don’t work…
You are in another process other than bash, zsh, and fish
The debugger should tell you what you need to do. Fig does work in SSH if you install the integration
Fig’s completions may not have installed correctly on your computer
Check the ~/.fig/autocomplete exists and contains a list of .js files
If it doesn’t:
Go to: ◧ > Settings > Developer > Run Install/Update Script to install the
Run fig update in your terminal to download the most up to date completion specs
Restart Fig
◧ > Restart
If Fig is only showing up some of the time
Check out this post:
Fig isn’t recommending filepaths
If you’ve tried everything above and still can’t get it to work
Join our Discord: fig.io/community
Email us: hello@fig.io
In general, this is a known issue for fish, bash, and when in an ssh session. Why? Fig uses a few different methods to work our your “edit buffer” (what you have typed in a given terminal session). We have a really strong integration with zsh but less strong for the others listed above. If you hit a bizarre key combination or even the arrow keys, Fig isn’t quite sure what you’ve typed and we will lose context…
For the time being, a good trick for when this happens is to hit ctrl + c and/or go to a new line!

207,207,No Title Found,"The pseudoterminal that Fig spawns in the background when you open up autocomplete is only initially sourced with minimal environment variables (mainly just your $PATH).
Sometimes, scripts that are run from a completion spec rely on these environment variables. e.g. the AWS completion spec uses the AWS CLI. The AWS CLI relies on environment variables like AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID etc (see them here
How do I set environment variables in Fig's pseudoterminal?
There are two ways:
1. ~/.fig/user/ptyrc
This file is sourced by the pseudoterminal every time autocomplete is loaded. Add your environment variables to the ptyrc file like this:
export MY_VARIABLE=""hello world""

2. Add items to your pty.env fig setting: fig settings pty.env '[""LESS"",""OLDPWD"",""AWS""]'
The pty.env setting takes a JSON array of strings.
Upon running fig source, Fig will source all environment variables in your current shell session that match the environment variables you have set in your pty.env setting. It will also match all environment variables that share a prefix with a string in your Fig settings.
e.g. If my pty.env setting was '[""AWS""]', then after running Fig source, all local environment variables starting with AWS (e.g. AWS, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION etc) will be set in Fig's pseudoterminal.
Note: Again, you must run fig source manually each time you want to set environment variables using this method. Fig does not know any of your environment variables exist unless you've added it to your ptyrc file or it's in your pty.env setting and you run fig source. We are exploring ways of doing this is more streamlined.
Other
When your pseudoterminal spawns, Fig also sources this file: ~/.fig/tools/ptyrc. However, this is overridden by the Fig team on every update.

225,225,Let completion spec request fresh pseudo terminal with full $PATH and env context,"Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I'm working on the Django completion spec
Django has a bunch of built-in tooling that provides information about the available subcommands, options, arguments, etc. I'm trying to build the Fig completion spec on top of this existing tooling
To make use of this built-in tooling, we can run python manage.py help or python manage.py help runserver and Django provides us with all we need to know: options, arguments, descriptions, etc.
And herein lies the problem ☝️ When using executeShellCommand, the pseudo terminal that actually executes the command doesn't share the exact same context as the terminal that the user is typing in. The user's terminal might have an activated python virtual environment, or other environment variables set that are necessary for python manage.py * commands to work.
Since the pseudo terminal is missing that context, running python manage.py help is likely to fail and our spec won't be able to retrieve the information it needs to populate the autocomplete suggestions
Describe the solution you'd like
Somewhere within my spec, I'd like to have a way to specify that I would like a ""fresh"" pseudo terminal, which shares all of the context as the shell the user is typing in. It should have the same $PATH and the same environment variables as the user's shell. If running python manage.py help succeeds in the user's shell, it should also succeed in the pseudo terminal that's running executeShellCommand(""python manage.py help"")
In terms of the API from the spec author perspective, one idea could be to make this an option within executeShellCommand . So perhaps I could do something like executeShellCommand(""python manage.py help"", {freshPseudoTerminal: true}) – just an idea though!
How should this work under the hood?
I definitely only have a very rough understanding of how fig works, but one approach could be to run env in the user's shell, and then re-export every entry from the env output in the pseudo terminal. That should set $PATH and also all other environment variables that might be required in order for python manage.py help to work.
My understanding based on this ☝️ is that fig could access env every time the prompt refreshes. So maybe the pseudo terminal env could be set based on the most recently stored env from when the prompt last refreshed in a given tty?
Describe alternatives you've considered
I think the main alternative that exists to all of this is to build the Django completion spec statically, and don't try to generate it at runtime based on the output from python manage.py help. This has the downside that we wouldn't be able to show completions for custom user-defined management commands. It would also decouple the spec from django itself, which presumably increases the maintenance burden of the spec quite substantially over time.

Describe alternatives you've considered
My spec could not rely on any static subcommand definitions and try to load everything dynamically. This was my original approach, and it works (in the right circumstances where the $PATH is set and all environment variable are present), but it's pretty slow.
I'd love to instead use this hybrid approach where the common autocomplete suggestions load instantly (due to their static definition in my spec), and then the dynamic ones are added to the list of suggestions as the much slower generateSpec and executeShellCommand finish",No Fig Diagnostic Found,"['codebase:autocomplete-app', 'type:feature-request']","Jul 9, 2021, 5:01 AM PDT"

Since Fig is experiencing issues with tmux/irssi right now, a user has had to disable Fig integration with SSH. However, they still want to be able to use Fig on their remote server, just outside of this specific case — they've requested more specificity in the cases where Fig can be disabled.
Regarding SSH and irssi; it totally works to disable the fig integration. But then it of course doesn't work for folders and commands on the remote server as well.

Error
Git commands fail with error:
fatal: Unable to create '/path/my_proj/.git/index.lock': File exists.
Fig runs git commands in the background to generate suggestions. An index.lock file is created, then removed when Fig's command finishes.
This error occurs because the index.lock file created by Fig's background command was not removed before executing the command.
To fix
Remove the .git/index.lock file.
In your project directory, run:
rm -f ./.git/index.lock
If there is no index.lock file to delete
There is a known issue with Fig not removing the index.lock file fast enough. This occurs in very large repos.
When you execute your git command before Fig finishes generating suggestions, the lock file is still in place and the command will fail to execute.
To fix
Wait for Fig to generate suggestions before executing the git command.

After installing brew, users are prompted to add the directory containing the new brew executable to their $PATH variable. However, the way Homebrew prompts users to do this is ambiguous (see below), and often causes the directory to be added to their $PATH variable every time they source a new terminal, rather than just once?
How do we know this? At Fig, many many users have presented us with bug reports saying Fig wasn't working. Turns out brew messing up the $PATH variable was the underlying cause.
Ambiguous Brew Prompt
When you install brew, you are prompted to add the directory containing the brew executable to your path. The prompt looks like this:
- Add Homebrew to your PATH in ~/.zprofile:
    echo 'eval ""$(/bin/brew shellenv)""' >> ~/.zprofile
    eval ""$(/bin/brew shellenv)""
This looks like the one code block but each line is actually two separate scripts on each line.
A large number of users just copy the whole codeblock and paste it it to their .bashrc or .zshrc and then continue on with their lives. You should actually execute both lines into your current shell session OR copy and paste the line starting with eval into your dotfiles. Do NOT copy the line starting with echo into your dotfiles. Copying the line starting with echo to your dotfiles ends up appending the line starting with eval to your dotfiles every time you spawn a new shell. This adds brew to your path each time. And now you see the issue.
How do I know if this error has happened to me?
Run
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'
Your $PATH is usually 5-15 lines. If you see the same line being repeated a million times, and that line contains brew, you have a problem!
How do I fix
Go through your dotfiles. Make sure to remove any line in your dot files (.profile, .zprofile, .bash_profile, .bashrc, .zshrc) that are similar to the line starting with echo or eval above
Paste the following into your chosen dotfile once
eval ""$(/bin/brew shellenv)""
More Info
The culprit: Line 751 of Brew's install script: https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/master/install.sh#L751
It appears other methods of installing brew add the executable to your /usr/local/bin/brew directory rather than appending a new directory to you $PATH.

302,302,Using the option app.hideMenubarIcon true terminates the fig process after exiting the terminal,"Description:
Actual Behaviour
Using app.hideMenubarIcon true sometimes terminate the Fig process without any errors after the terminal closes and opens again.
If you hide the icon using the command app.hideMenubarIcon true in the terminal, at some point after the next exit from the terminal, the Fig finishes its own process and you should run it again from the program folder. It happens sometimes, not after every exit. With visible icons, it's never happening.
Expected Behaviour
Using app.hideMenubarIcon true doesn't terminate the Fig process after the terminal closes and opens.
In normal cases, when app.hideMenubarIcon false and the icon is visible, after closing the terminal the Fig icon remains in the top menu. It means the Fig remains in working condition and the process doesn’t close after the terminal closes or open.

User description of problem:
I use Keyboard Maestro (https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) and I've started adding some frequently used shell commands as KM macros. Keyboard Maestro can choose which macros to display based on the window (or tab) title.
So, for example, I could have a set of macros configured to be available only when my iTerm 2 window has a title containing 'mailadmin@mailserver'.
For some reason, however, when fig is running, iTerm might include the 'mailadmin@mailserver' string in the visible window title, but the real name of the window -- as seen by Keyboard Maestro -- is 'fig@ssh'. As a result, Keyboard Maestro couldn't distinguish between sessions, and couldn't display the relevant command set.",No Fig Diagnostic Found,"['codebase:macos', 'type:bug']","Jul 22, 2021, 9:29 PM PDT"

I have the SSH integration added, why can't I push to my companies self-hosting gitlab instance?
Okay so first off, great job, this app is so sweet. Honestly, the best terminal app out there.
Nevertheless, I ran into this when setting up fig. Essentially when going through the setup (before cli tutorial), it asks if you it can edit your .ssh/config file or skip for later. Me unknowingly and way too excited, of course I allowed fig to.
Right after I enabled this I couldn't pull/push to/from my local repos because the remotes couldn't be found / interacted with. So anyways, I uninstalled fig and reinstalled it without editing the ssh folder and it now works just like before!
So yeah, im not very adverse in SSH connections, but it was something to do with that messing up my connection with my company's gitlab instance, I presume authentication. I thought I'd bring this up in-case anyone else had the same scenario.

Perhaps as a plugin, suggestions maybe?
Or something like what fzf does? (Type ~~ then press tab and it opens a finder, once selecting something that is put onto the command line)
Support as a shell plugin: Perhaps this would take a command and give suggestions manually, e.g. fig ""git br"" would give nice colored results

330,330,Crash upon first keystroke in CLI onboarding,"Description:
First time using Fig, on first keystroke through the CLI onboarding process the iTerm crashed without any error.
The debugger didn't throw any error either.
Upon going to your troubleshooting page a suggestion about restarting arised (which I would've done). It worked absolutely great!
The only problem is that I know didn't try Fig through the CLI onboarding process which seemed cool.
It seems to me like an early beta bug so I checked for an already existing issue here but didn't find one that match quite well so sorry if this issue ends up being a duplicate.

Fig should allow the setting of a keybinding to open the window. IDEs allow intellisense or similar windows to be opened or closed on key press. Example: ctrl + space or user defined keybinding would open autocomplete window rather than space after a command.

Issue Details
Summary
Fig should support multiple versions of CLIs and make suggestions based on the version that is installed on the user's machine.
Example
One user may be using yarn version 1, whereas another is using version 2. The CLIs for the two major yarn versions have some differences. For example, yarn 1 has the subcommand yarn global, whereas yarn 2 has removed this subcommand, and replaced it (more or less) with yarn dlx. Discrepancies between different versions applies to all CLIs. Fig needs to decide which commands, subcommands, options, and arguments to suggest based on the user's installed version of a CLI.
Let's open a discussion around how this should be implemented.
Steps to Reproduce
Install yarn v2
In a terminal with fig enabled, type yarn
You will see that global is suggested
You will not see dlx as a suggestion
This is because the current yarn spec in fig/autocomplete is for version 1.
Expected Results
Autocomplete suggestions should reflect the CLI version installed on the machine.
Actual Results
Autocomplete suggestions reflect the (sole) CLI version defined in the spec.

My issue does not relate to a specific CLI completion spec (e.g. git checkout is missing options in git completion spec). If it does, please create your issue here: withfig/autocomplete
Issue Details
Summary
Currently, fig makes suggestions solely based on what is defined in the autocomplete spec. Instead, it should filter suggestions based on what is installed on the user's machine. Fig should not suggest commands for CLIs that are not installed. Instead, it should inform the user that the CLI they are intending to use is not installed, and perhaps even direct them to an install command or link.
Steps to Reproduce
Ensure a given CLI defined in the spec is uninstalled (pick your favorite)
For example, let's use yarn. Uninstall yarn if you have it.
In a terminal that uses fig, type the command for that cli
Continuing with our example, type yarn
Fig suggests commands for the CLI, even though they will not work (because it is not installed)
Expected Results
When a user attempts to use a CLI that is not installed, yarn should inform the user that it is not installed, and link to a webpage with install instructions
Actual Results
Fig provides suggestions as if the user would be able to use them.

388,388,iTerm2 SSH as a Profile does not disable Fig when SSH integration should be disabled,"Description:
Due to Fig not adapting to the SSH host and trying to autocomplete using the client's context I decided to go ahead and disable SSH integartion for now, I unchecked Integartions > SSH Integration and modified my ~/.ssh/config to the following:
# ControlPath ~/.ssh/%C
# ControlMaster auto
# ControlPersist 1
# PermitLocalCommand yes
# LocalCommand fig bg:ssh ~/.ssh/%C &

# Fig SSH Integration: Enabled
# 
# Include ~/.fig/ssh
# 
# End of Fig SSH Integration
This works fine if I start SSH manually in my iTerm session (ssh user@host) but it doesn't work with an iTerm2 profile that automatically launches SSH. I've tried it two ways:
When I use the Command option with ssh command parameter Fig does remain active but does ask me to Hit enter to regain context.
I suspected the problem might be that using the Command version of the profile, since it never actually echoes the ssh command, might not give Fig any context to recognize that the terminal is in an SSH session so I then tried using a Login Shell with Send text at start. This does echo out the command at the beginning of the shell initialization.
Unfortunately it gives me a very similar result, in this case Fig doesn't ask me to regain context but it does still show Fig with autocompletions from the client machine.
Out of curiosity I did also try the Custom shell option with Bash (default & Homebrew) as well as Fish but neither seemed to actually execute Send text at start correctly and I didn't think it would be worth troubleshooting further.

I often get ""double"" characters if I type a little quickly and hit ""Tab"" when navigating directories. It definitely seems dependent on the speed I type because if I slow down, I don't see the problem.
So typing ""/Vol"" and hitting tab fairly quickly results in ""/Vollumes"" (double ""l"").

I just started using Fig and I like what I see. Amazing idea of you to build this!
I just installed Fig and started playing around with it. But I noticed that every time I open a new terminal session in my macOS home folder (~), I get the following message:
/Users/ralphjsmit/.fig/shell/zle.zsh:115: no such file or directory: vendor/bin/phpunit
This is weird and quite irritating to have an error message pop up every time I open a terminal window ;-)
And even weirder is this: if I open a folder with composer and vendor/bin/phpunit installed, I get the message:
PHPUnit 9.5.8 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

Unknown option ""-z""
My .zshrc file:
#### FIG ENV VARIABLES ####
# Please make sure this block is at the start of this file.
[ -s ~/.fig/shell/pre.sh ] && source ~/.fig/shell/pre.sh
#### END FIG ENV VARIABLES ####

## Custom aliases and $PATH additions

#### FIG ENV VARIABLES ####
[ -s ~/.fig/fig.sh ] && source ~/.fig/fig.sh
#### END FIG ENV VARIABLES ####
I briefly investigated this and it looks like the following code in .fig/shell/zle.sh is the culprit:
# Ensure compatibility w/ z-asug -- resolves https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues/62
# Add `fig_insert_and_clear_autosuggestion` to list of widgets that clear suggestions, if not already included
if ! test -z ""$ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_CLEAR_WIDGETS"" && ! (($ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_CLEAR_WIDGETS[(Ie)fig_insert_and_clear_autosuggestion])); then

The terminal starts up and shows the welcome message that shows me how fig works. I type ""cd"" and then the terminal disappears. Even trying to take a screenshot will immediately close the session. Something really funky is going on here.
If I turn ""Autocomplete"" off, then it stops crashing. (Of course, then Fig doesn't really do much I assume.)

Issue Details
Description:
Iterm have this feature - When start typing in Iterm, and then look for history using the UP arrow it will only show history starting with the text typed. (e.g typing ""fig"" and pressing the UP arrow will navigate through commands in history that start with ""fig"" - like ""fig --help"", ""fig source"" and so on depends on the history).
The issue is that when using Fig on Iterm and pressing UP, the typed text is ignored and the action in cycling through recent history chronological without filtering.
I've looked a little and it seems that while using Fig I can get a similar, but more complex, action using typing and hitting ctrl+R (shows popup with history relevant to the text) - But I'm looking for the simple UP arrow functionality defaulted for Iterm.

434,434,No Title Found,"Brew version 3.2.10 was released 4 days ago (30 August 2021). Around this time, tons of Fig users started complaining that inserting suggestions using Fig's autocomplete wasn't working as expected. After several days of banging our heads against a wall, we finally put two and two together. We have pushed a temporary fix to all Fig users and have alerted the Homebrew team.
What's the brew bug?
In brew version 3.2.10, the brew install <formula> command alters your tty drivers (specific terminal settings) and does not turn them off. Namely it turns on the following: istrip, echonl, -imaxbel, ignbrk
You can verify this by running stty -a before and after running brew install
How does this affect Fig / my terminal?
Immediately after running brew install you will notice the following:
An extra line will be added after executing a command
Emojis and other non-7-bit ASCII characters won't display
If using Fig + zsh, inserting a suggestion results in just a ' or a ( character inserted as opposed to the suggestion. (see gif below)
Why? Fig binds a custom unicode character to the text to be inserted. Inserting this unicode character inserts the text. The istrip setting that brew install turns on breaks the insertion of any unicode char.
How do I know if this affects me?
Run brew --version.
If you are on version 3.2.10 it will likely affect you.
If you are on a lower version, it may still affect you. Brew defaults to updating version every time you run brew install. You can temporarily turn off auto-updates (see below).
How do I downgrade to brew version 3.2.9?
Fortunately, brew is entirely local
if [[ ""$(uname -m)"" == ""arm64"" ]]; then
    cd /opt/homebrew 
else
    cd /usr/local/Homebrew
fi

git fetch --tags
git checkout 3.2.9

brew --version
How do I disable auto-updates
Add the following to your .zshrc or .bashrc. Remember to remove this when you want to upgrade brew again.
export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1
How do I get Fig working?
Make sure you are on Fig version 1.0.48
◧ > Check for Updates...
How do I upgrade to brew 3.2.11 when it's released?
brew update
[Optional], delete the export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 from your dotfiles

Let's imagine this directory:

Typing the cd at command would show this auto-complete list:
Notice how athenajs appears at the bottom of the list instead of being at the top.
This isn't intuitive. Note that changing the sort suggestions setting doesn't fix the problem.

436,436,Off-baseline text rendering when using custom fonts,"Description:
Hey, first of all, thanks for a great product :-) Really enjoy using it!
Just noticed a minor aesthetic quirk when changing the font used for the autocompletion window (from the default to JetBrains Mono Light Nerd Font Complete), and also changing the font size (in this case to 11).
As you can see from the screenshot below, the rendered text in the completion list is not on the same baseline as the icon (e.g., see how the icon for the Documents/ entry seems to be vertically centred, however, the text for that row seems to be anchored to the top). Not sure if this is a known issue or not, so I thought I'd report here just in case it wasn't.

Differentiate autocomplete by script name instead of file name.
If I want to create an autocomplete for homebrew-cask-upgrade, I now need to edit this file, but the better way to do is to create a new file.
The script for homebrew-cask-upgrade is brew cu, Fig now detects autocomplete by file name, so another file that has a brew command will not work.

Feature Details
Description
I think it would be good to have a ""processor"" icon built in, since it's a pretty general concept. It would be useful in compilers (eg. cargo, go) and binary managers (eg. rustup). Probably more uses I can't think of off the top of my head.
Motivation
While writing the spec for deno, I wanted to add an icon for the compilation targets. There's not really a fitting icon... ""string"" is the closest, but it's not great.
This is what I came up with as a stop-gap solution (it's supposed to look like a CPU, top-down)

463,463,Allow generating dynamic options based on subcommands arguments,"Sanity checks
I have searched github.com/withfig/fig/issues and there are no duplicates of my feature
Feature Details
Description:
Currently, we can dynamically generate fulls specs or suggestions for arguments, but we don't have a way to generate dynamic options. This limits the ability to have options depending on the argument being passed to a subcommand.
Consider the following scenario:
Nx CLI allows us to run many different generators provided by plugins. For example:
nx generate @nrwl/workspace:library my-lib --buildable
Decomposing the previous example:
nx is the command.
generate is a subcommand.
@nrwl/workspace:library is an argument for the subcommand. This is called a ""generator"" (do not confuse with Fig generators) and it represents what we are actually going to generate.
my-lib (a positional argument matching the --name option) and --buildable are options.
Each Nx generator can have different options, therefore, based on the specified Nx generator (e.g. @nrwl/workspace:library), the options will be different. Also, there's not a fixed number of generators (more can be created by the community and individual Nx monorepos can have different sets of generators), so we can't just statically define their specs.
This is a perfect example where we can benefit from dynamic options. We need to resolve them based on the specified Nx generator (the argument for the generate subcommand).
Alternatives
I tried to use the generateSpec option and dynamically generate the full spec for the generate subcommand, turning the above @nrwl/workspace:library into a subcommand instead of an argument, by doing:
Added a generateSpec to the generate subcommand.
In that function, resolved the list of installed plugins in the monorepo (user working directory) that contain generators. Running nx list and parsing the output to get the installed plugins that contain generators.
Resolved the list of generators per resolved plugin. Running nx list <plugin-name> (per plugin) and parsing the output to get the generators.
Resolved the list of options per resolved generator. Running nx generate <generator-name> --help (per generator in each plugin) and parsing the output to get the options.
As it can be seen in the above process, a lot needs to happen in order to get the full spec. A monorepo with just 3 plugins each containing 5 generators would require 19 different shell command executions and parsing to get what's needed for the spec. An average Nx monorepo would contain more than that.
I had no success with it (in a small monorepo with just a few plugins), the generation fails more often than not with a timeout error in the development environment. Having to load all the generators and their definition upfront is not performant.
By having the ability to dynamically generate options, we can lazy load parsing the options to when they are needed and only get the options for the specified generator.",No Fig Diagnostic Found,"['codebase:autocomplete-app', 'type:feature-request']","Sep 19, 2021, 9:17 AM PDT"

Description:
The issue seems to happen when having multiple windows opened in one iTerm tab with different directories. To whichever directory I navigate last, its autocompletes are available to the rest of the windows regardless of the directory.
For example, I have a monorepo setup and I open three iTerm windows within one tab. First, in two of them, I navigate to the root of the project in which I have a specific package.json, with specific custom yarn commands. Those commands will appear in the autocomplete suggestion as they should. Now, in the third window, I navigate to one subdirectory (one of the packages of the monorepo), which has its own package.json with its own specific custom commands. In that third window, again, correct commands appear for autocomplete, but however, for the rest of the windows (that are set for the root directory of the project) they are not correct and autocomplete suggests commands of the subdirectory.

But I'm missing it with these commands (aliases):

I got used to to pnpm i because it worked with only with npm i, but not with npm add.
I believe it's possible to make the same aliases as you have for pnpm remove.

Issue Details
Description:
I have iTerm2 installed (using Fish shell & Starship) and I use extensively iTerm's split panes. Listed some problems that make Fig unusable with my setup:
Fig autocomplete always only works in the last created split pane
Occasionally when creating a new split pane, iTerm2 ends the session with message:
Warning
A session ended very soon after starting. Check that the command in profile ""[profile-name]"" is correct.
A keystroke in a previous split pane causes all later created split panes to crash
Interestingly, the iTerm session crash occurs only when creating multiple split panes to the same direction - when altering between horizontal and vertical split panes it didn't happen, but the split panes would still crash with a keystroke in any of the earlier created split panes.
The problems remained even after quitting Fig - only after uninstalling Fig the problems disappear. Also tried uninstalling Starship, but it had no effect.

533,533,VS Code Terminal Double Pasting Autocomplete,"Description:
Please include a detailed description of the issue (and an image or screen recording, if applicable)
When using the autocomplete feature in VS Code for checking out into a Github branch, the autocomplete I'm trying to achieve is pasted into the terminal twice and is overlapping. For example these are the following steps I performed and the result I achieved:
I typed 'git checkout' into the VS Code terminal (I'm using bash as my terminal here).
The autocomplete for my branch appears, in this case the branch was 'git checkout 295-implement-delivery-report-renderer'
After hitting enter, the text in my terminal now is 'git checkout 295-implem295-implement-delivery-report-rendererent-delivery-report-renderer
This behavior does not seem to happen when I'm in the regular Mac terminal and seems to function as desired. I'm only having this problem when using the terminal within VS Code.
Hope this helps!

Would be great if fig could use the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory for storing it's config files. After installning lots of software the home directory quickly turns into a mess. A cleaner way that also makes it easier to backup all of our software config would be to use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fig. The files then would be located at ~/.config}/fig.

I currently store my zsh files, including .zshrc, in ~/.config/zsh by putting ZDOTDIR=$HOME/.config/zsh in my ~/.zshenv. After updating fig to the latest version it created a new .zshrc in my home directory even though zsh is configured to look for the config in ~/.config/zsh. Is it possible to configure fig to look and edit .zshrc by first looking for it with the ZDOTDIR variable?
Also, is it really necessary for fig to recreate .bashrc and .profile when I'm using zsh?

Under Settings -> General, I change Tab Behavior to ""insert"" or ""insertOrPrefix"" but it doesn't change the behavior; the completion list just shakes when I hit tab. I would expect that setting to cause it to insert the completion as that is more natural for me than hitting return to insert it.

Issue Details
Description:
Fig only works once whenever I open a new tab/terminal session (i.e. autocompletes cd command). After executing the command fig isn't showing up anymore.
It seems to be related to powerline-shell. If I remove the setup calls from my .bash_profile everything seems to work fine. But I like powerline-shell...
I'm using the setup steps from here: https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell#bash
I tried adding the block before and after the #### FIG ENV VARIABLES #### block. No change.
fig tools doctor also reports a problem with an incompatible version of iTerm but I'm using the latest available version.

570,570,Inserting extraneous slashes,"Choosing an autocomplete suggestion that includes spaces sometimes inserts backslashes in front of spaces. I have been able to replicate this issue reasonably consistently with the following steps:

This results in the following text being input to the shell prompt:

When I start tmux, an annoying window pops up saying fig Tmux Integration: Enabled does not exist. There's no way to suppress this warning message. See screenshot. Despite the warning, Fig autocomplete still works well inside tmux.
I can see that the following lines were added to the end of my ~/.tmux.conf.local:
# Fig Tmux Integration: Enabled
source-file ~/.fig/tmux
# End of Fig Tmux Integration
Interesting, when running fig diagnostic, it says Tmux Integration: false.

maybe fig isn't compatible with some of the things I downloaded?

I checked iTerm (where i tested it upon initial install as well) and it still works. The iterm session was also left open overnight. So overall, fig is running but the autocomplete feature seems to have ceased only in the VSCode terminal (which is the main reason i installed fig)

Issue Details
Programming in portable posix shell is easy. The major bash-ism I see in your code is '[[' which can be easily replaced with 'test'/'['. There is really no need to consider sh/bash/zsh as separate languages -just one language with some extensions that can be checked with 'if'. Fish really is different, though.
ShellCheck is your friend and will help you avoid both portability issues and common bugs.
Whether or not you choose to do this, make sure to regularly run ShellCheck on all scripts. Preferably add it to the automatic workflow.

620,620,Expose environment variables to generators,"Sanity checks
I have searched github.com/withfig/fig/issues and there are no duplicates of my feature
Feature Details
Description:
This is similar to #225, but does not require the shell to have the same variables - just to give generators access to them.
I'd like some way to use the user's environment variables in a generator.
My primary use case for this is for deno run --allow-env=var1,var2,etc.... It would be nice to suggest the user's actual environment variables.
Here are my ideas for how this could look in a spec:
// 1. ""env"" template
const A: Fig.Generator = {
  getQueryTerm: "","",
  template: ""env"",
};

// 2. ShellContext function (explicitly request a Map<string, string>, or maybe just a plain object?)
const B: Fig.Generator = {
  getQueryTerm: "","",
  custom: async (tokens, executeShellCommand, shellContext) => {
    return (await shellContext.getEnvironment())
      .entries()
      .map(([name, value]) => ({ name, description: value }));
  },
};
Of course, I don't know the internals of the autocomplete engine - I'd imagine copying the environment is easy enough but keeping it up to date would be more challenging.

630,630,Fig autoupdates on launch of each new terminal and loss of terminal focus,"Sanity checks
I have searched github.com/withfig/fig/issues and there are no duplicates of my issue
Issue Details
Description:
Firstly I am very much enjoying Fig- thank you for all of your development efforts!
Fig runs autoupdates on each new terminal instance (perhaps this is by design), however if I check 'disable autoupdate' in settings I am greeted with the message A new version of Fig is available. (Autoupdates are disabled), which seems to be inconsistent behaviour. I have manually checked for updates in the menu bar application which confirms that this I have the latest version (1.0.52 (B317)), so I am not sure where this message comes from.
I am okay with autoupdates on each terminal instance if this is the desired behaviour, however when this occurs the focus is taken away from my terminal after a couple seconds, which prevents me from inputting commands there, and this is a nuisance. I have confirmed that if 'disable autoupdates' is checked then the focus remains on the terminal so I believe that the loss of focus is related to the reoccurring autoupdate. I have attached a screen recording which hopefully illustrates the loss of focus here (the menu bar greys out at the end of the clip).
I recently installed Fig from HomeBrew, which may be relevant to this (I don't remember this behaviour during the preview).

Description:
In bash if you have a folder called src and you type cd src + TAB you will see cd src/ (the slash is appended).
When fig is installed you don't have this feature and either you need to add the slash yourself or you need to move the arrow down and select 'src/'.
I don't think that this should be the default behaviour and that when you click on 'tab' like in the normal bash the '/' is appended.

I have searched github.com/withfig/fig/issues and there are no duplicates of my feature
Feature Details
Description:
Please include a detailed description of the feature (and an image or screen recording, if applicable)
While writing the spec for just (https://github.com/casey/just) I hit a limitation of fig.
Say we have the following ""justfile"":
test FILTER:
    deno test --no-check --unstable --allow-read=./data --filter {{FILTER}}

bundle:
    deno run scripts/bundle.ts

render:
    deno run scripts/render.ts
We can run multiple ""recipes"" from that file at once.
just bundle render
That's fine, Fig can handle that!
Where we hit a problem, however, is with test, because it takes an argument.
This is a valid command that I can't model with a spec:
just test API bundle render
In this case, one of the arguments (test) takes an argument itself (API).
I'd like to be clear first off, these aren't subcommands. They're arguments provided to just to tell it which recipes to run and with what arguments.
What I've tried
This can't be done using generateSpec + options, because Fig gets very confused by options that don't start with dashes (even with parseDirectives.flagsArePosixNoncompliant set to false). On top of that, because the justfile can be changed with -f/--justfile the suggestions would be inaccurate some of the time, and that's not super ideal
This can't be done with subcommands, because subcommands are exclusive. If generateSpec creates a spec with subcommands, you can use one, sure, but you won't get autocomplete for any additional recipes.
This can't be done with args because they can't take args themselves.

First of all, thank you guys for such a revolutionary tool. You are amazing 🎉
I just realized that I think starting from the installation of fig, some apple scripts that are running commands in the terminal don't work any more. A simple reproduction apple script is:
tell application ""Terminal""
 do script ""echo 'hello world'""
end tell
The result of that looks like so:
It seems that the first character of the script is skipped (and some weird stuff is added to the input of the terminal after the command execution).
My current workaround is simply adding a whitespace as the first character of the command:
tell application ""Terminal""
 do script "" echo 'hello world'""

If you have two folders: teamcity/ and TeamCity/ and type out cd team then hit tab, Fig's default is to shake.
I'm not sure whether this should be the default or not.
Perhaps if the user explicitly types a capital letter then we should do exact match but if the user does not type a capital letter we should insert shared prefix as if all are lowercase...
At a minimum we should have a setting for this.

Description:
When mac just reloaded or comes out of sleep, sometimes fig autocomplete just stops working.
And it looks like this issue about internet connection because when I got the issue again and opened debug console I saw that some modules didn't load. After off/on to autocomplete in fig menu we got new logs in the console and everything works fine. So I think probably the module doesn't have time to load and do this before mac is online.

Issue Details
Description:
Very often I use the up or down arrows to navigate my recent command history, when using fig, each of those commands opens the autocomplete window.
When I use the up arrow, I need to double-tap it to close the autocomplete window then continue,
with the down arrow I need to scroll all of the autocomplete options, and even when you reach the end of the list, pressing down again doesn't close it. So I need to first click ESC to close it then I can continue.
When you navigate through a lot of commands this becomes really bothersome, I think the solution can be to not show the autocomplete window if the key-press before it was up or down.
Video (the key-presses UI doesn't show it, but I'm repeatedly pressing down):

Feature Details
Description:
Currently, my main development environment is a Linux box which is available to my Macbook and other clients via OpenVPN. When I want to access it via a single terminal, I use mosh for the best experience and VSCode with SSH for coding. In this way, I can have a supercomputer with no fan noise or risk of explosion or burned legs.
Blueprints
A daemon that lives in a Linux environment or a Mosh reimplementation for connecting the Fig client with the SSH environment (latency is invisible for Mosh even from long distances and this never dies, but support via normal SSH port forwarding is enough and may be faster to implement). (Related to #34)
A VSCode plugin for doing the same for SSH-based environments.

I guess that seems Fig depends heavily on network too much:

Why I guess so? As my scenario:
Fig completion works fine at office.
Then move to home.

Install Fig completion specs (plugins) on-demand so you can include only the CLI completions you need.
The Problem
Having all completion specs in one repo and adding them all to Fig by default will not scale very well and can make Fig slow and bigger.
The Solution
It would be great if we can add completion specs when needed by running something like
fig add firebase
or
fig install firebase
or maybe have a GUI for it in the Fig app.
And have Fig add them to our completion specs, we can have the specs in a Fig registery for example, or maybe fetch them directly from GitHub or a URL.
Benefits
Users can create plugins (specs) without the need to add them to the Fig autocomplete repo which eliminates some of the work that the Fig team had to do (reviewing and adding the specs to Fig).
Users can add specs when needed and not download all the specs at once.

I use ZSH and I love the ability to type partial commands and then press the up arrow to only show recent commands starting with what I've typed.
For example:
kubectl get pods
kubectl get ds
Now if I type kubectl get p then press the up arrow, it will skip the get ds part of my history and go straight to kubectl get pods
With fig, this is broken. Using the above example, if I type kubectl get p and press the up arrow it will go to kubectl get ds.

If you attempt to run the command as suggested, it will not work, and you'll receive the error ""chmod: -R: No such file or directory."" This is compounded by the fact that, once you have made this error one time, the erroneous suggestion will float to the top of your suggestion list.
Ideally, fig would insert the argument at the appropriate location. For instance, in the above example, someone typing chmod 644 - would still see -R as a suggestion, but when they accept the suggestion, the -R flag would be inserted between ""chmod"" and ""644.""

    git status

compdef g='git'

Issue Details
Description:
I've just getting set up with Fig and have just added the shell integration to my .bash_profile. I was initially getting the __bp_sanitize_string: command not found error, but following the linked issue I updated my iTerm2 bash integration. However, now I instead get the string existing_prompt_command printed after running any command. It's printed twice when starting a session or sourcing my .bash_profile. Like so:
Last login: Sat Jan  8 22:01:33 on ttys003
existing_prompt_commandexisting_prompt_command
$ echo hello
hello
existing_prompt_command
$ git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
existing_prompt_command
$
Fig's autocompletion itself is working fine, but this is quite annoying. The same thing happens on iTerm2 and macOS Terminal. When I remove the line sourcing ~/.fig/fig.sh the issue goes away.
Here's the line in my .bash_profile for customising my prompt, in case that's relevant:
export PS1=""\[\033[33;1m\]\w\[\033[m\](\t)\[\033[1;97m\]$\[\033[0m\] ""

When I type short commands, Fig is less important to me. For instance, yarn start is so ingrained in muscle memory that it's faster to just type the whole thing than to select a suggestion. However, when I type yarn start and hit enter, Fig interprets that ""enter"" as me wanting to select the option instead of allowing the shell to execute the command. I would expect when I type out a full command (i.e. the input text and the suggestion text are identical) and I hit enter, my intent is to execute the command.
I could be missing important cases where my expectation here is wrong, or maybe I changed a setting I shouldn't have. Please feel free to tell me I'm wrong :)

Particularly for the standard grep utility (and I expect others), Fig does not autosuggest an option more than once. For example, grep's --exclude-dir parameter (documentation here), which is used to exclude a single directory from search, can be repeated multiple times in order to exclude multiple directories, such as: grep -r foo --exclude-dir foo/bar --exclude-dir foo/baz
However, if --exclude-dir is entered once (autosuggesting correctly the first time), Fig fails to autosuggest the same option afterwards.

first attempt is slow (i.e. pause after ssh), then TAB
second attempt is slow, then RETURN
third attempt is fast (i.e. no pause after ssh), then TAB
It looks like a race-condition where Fig is competing with the zsh auto-complete and I end up with a garbled result.

Issue Details
Switching between tabs takes 6 seconds.
Fig integration uses child_process.execFile() to interact with Fig, but that's extremely slow when you're in a notarized macOS Electron application (see electron/electron#26143).
Tabby includes a patched version of node-pty (as @tabby-gang/node-pty) that uses posix_spawn instead of fork/exec to circumvent this.
So the integration just needs to swap out child_process for it.

Description:
After #706 was solved(thanks!) I updated fig (clicked on fig > check for update > install (or whatever the rightmost one is)).
After the update, Fig asked me to enable the accessibility permission again, even though it was already enabled, so I needed to tick it off and on again.
Also, Fig requested access to folders again (open terminal, cd Desktop, and get an access dialog to allow fig access to the Desktop folder), even though I gave permissions in the previous version

808,808,Improve fig doctor UX if shell integration is not set up correctly.,"Currently, this is the output from fig doctor if the shell integration is not sourced correctly:
Also fig doctor continues with other diagnostic checks and this this message isn't visible when the script finishes.
Fix:
Communicate more clearly that this warning must be resolved for Fig to work.
I think the UX here could be to stop the flow and wait for the user to confirm that they've made changes. Then check again.
Motivation:
Since we've switched to figterm for getting the edit buffer, Fig's shell integration must be sourced last. Popular plugins, most notably p10k, break Fig with their default installation.
A lot of new ""autocomplete isn't popuping up"" or ""insertion isn't working"" support requests are due to misconfigured dotfiles. Giving these users a self-serve support option is high priority.",No Fig Diagnostic Found,"['codebase:cli', 'type:feature-request']","Jan 20, 2022, 4:41 PM PST"

Issue Details
On every startup spotlight indexing is triggered by figterm.
It should be indexed once unless there are changes to the file system.
The issue is gone when fig is commented out in .zshrc and .zprofile.
It's a major performance issue as it tasks the cpu heavily on each os startup.
Description:
Run sudo fs_usage to inspect the spotlight indexing.
It seems the indexing is in an infinite loop. The processes are reocurring.

Fig works with iTerm, the native MacOS Terminal app, Hyper and the integrated terminal in VSCode.

To me, it feels and looks like it should have inserted ""autocomplete."" but because some fuzzy search matches weren't at the beginning of the name, the only common prefix was ""a"" so it actually removed the ""uto"" instead of inserting anything.

Description:
TLDR: A way to solve conflicts between CLI's with the same command
I noticed that I get a wrong autocomplete suggestions for the task command,
That's because I refer to task runner called ""Task"" (https://taskfile.dev/)
And Fig got auto-completion for a different CLI tool called ""Taskwarrior""
I want to open a PR with a spec file for ""Task"" but I didn't find a way to co-exist with the task warrior command without changing the task.ts file that's in the responsibility of another developer.
Possible solution
Generic solution:
Add a section to the spec that will use for identifying the desired CLI by the command output or by checking for a file to exists in the current folder (e.g Taskfile)
Solutions only for task command collision:
Treat ""Task"" and ""Taskwarrior"" as different versions of the same CLI, in the same task.ts file and perform version check before returning the spec like the example here
Create a new task.ts file that will perform some check and return the spec from taskfile.ts or taskwarrior.ts

923,923,[Beta] Noticeable delay in autocomplete suggestions showing up after insertion,"After updating to the most recent beta (build 374), I started to notice the suggestions popped up slower than before. This was especially in the cd suggestions after inserting the first directory. e.g. going from cd[space] to cd desktop/
According to the videos, the time between the text being inserted and the popup showing has almost doubled (from ~60ms to ~110ms). Unfortunately, these statistics seems to be accurate in the +/- 33ms range (as the screencast was 30FPS) AND the millisecond stopwatch wasn't running smoothly (as in it didn't directly count from 1.001 to 1.002, rather 1.001 to around 1.035).
In any case, the difference is almost 2 lots of 33ms and I believe that this is therefore significant enough to be true.
Below, I compare the videos as if it's a c figterm vs rust figterm issue. Disregard this. Just think of it as prod build vs beta build.

Optimal outcome here is to get it so suggestions appears as fast as possible. Remember, we are competing with shell suggestions which are lightning fast.
In the past we have had users leave as Fig was popping up slowly. This was really early days Fig. I don't believe I have seen users leave because suggestions have popped up too slowly recently (ie in past few months), except for users who had bugs.
I understand there are engineering constraints that may prevent us from getting back down to 30ms. I would love to do this one day. However, I think we should at least get back to levels we were experiencing with c figterm.
Matt seems to know what the cause is (comment below).

Description:
If I type a command like or have any autocomplete (just easier to show with a command):
ls ~/.fig
Then fig's autocomplete kicks in as usual, when I have fuzzy enabled you can see (in the video I posted), that the redraw seems to be a bit broken? It will remove backwards whatever the autocomplete returns as. Might be something with my bashrc perhaps or something conflicting.

Installed fig via Homebrew on my MacBook Air m1 - installation worked fine but the autocomplete-feature did not work in the initial walkthrough. I use iterm2 by default, even after restarting it the autocomplete menu didn't show up. After ""skipping"" the walkthrough it worked afterwards.
The command fig doctor doesn't work too, it just runs without an output...

I tried putting the fig lines from the .zshrc into separate files to import via source, so basically changing this:
[ -s ~/.fig/shell/pre.sh ] && source ~/.fig/shell/pre.sh

...

[ -s ~/.fig/fig.sh ] && source ~/.fig/fig.sh
to this:
source ""$ZSH_DOTFILE_LOCATION""/load_before.zsh

...

source ""$ZSH_DOTFILE_LOCATION""/load_after.zsh
Fig still does work properly, but the debugger reports a false warning and prompts me to re-run the installation script

This is basically out of curiosity and I haven't ran into an issue yet.
So imagine there is a cli called cli at version a.b.c. It has a few commands c1, c2 and c3 - deprecated. At the next major version b.0.0, it introduced a new command c4 and it removed the deprecated command c3. A similar argument can be made for options as well.
Is it currently possible to write a spec for this particular cli where the c3 command is shown in the autocomplete if the installed cli version is < b.0.0 and not shown otherwise (similarly, c4 should be shown only if the cli version is >= b.0.0)?
If this is not currently possible, how I would envision it is to have a few properties on the command and option objects -
versionAdded to indicate the version where the command/option was added (optional)
versionRemoved to indicate the version where the command/option was removed (optional)
A spec can have a versionCommand which would get the particular version installed, which can be compared with the versionAdded and versionRemoved fields and then selectively enable/disable that command/option. This is mandatory for a spec if any option/command has versionAdded or versionRemoved
If both versionAdded and versionRemoved are unspecified, then the command/option would always be available
If versionAdded is present and versionRemoved is not, then the command/option would be available if the current version >= versionAdded
If versionAdded is not present and versionRemoved is present, then the command/option would be available if the current version < versionRemoved
If both versionAdded and versionRemoved are present, then the command/option would be available only if versionAdded <= current version < versionRemoved",No Fig Diagnostic Found,['Error Getting Details'],Publish Date Not Found

Issue Details
Description:
After the latest update, the Pycharm terminal seems to have a broken behavior
It seems like it doesn't fully source my .bash_profile, after the terminal starts my PS1 prompt is the default, and none of my aliases are defined
Closing the terminal prompts a confirmation window, warning that there is still a process running in that terminal
Before the update, opening the terminal already opened it with my python virtualenv activated, now it doesn't
I noticed this issue #49 and run the commands from this comment #49 (comment), which made fig work in my terminal but didn't fix any of the previous issues
Might this can help you figure it out:
Commenting only the final line in .bash_profile fixed issue 1 only if I manually run source ~/.bash_profile
Commenting only the first line fixes all 3 issues, but fig doesn't work in that case
fig_issue.mov
If anyone else has this issue, I use this workaround for now:
In pycharm's setting make the terminal start with a env variable ""BASH_FROM_PYCHARM=true""
then change the lines in .bash_profile to
if [ -z $BASH_FROM_PYCHARM ]; then
  export PATH=""${PATH}:${HOME}/.local/bin"";
  eval ""$(fig init bash pre)"";

Issue Details
Description:
When writing something like console.log('one', 'two')in a spec, I only see 'one' in the console.
Example code:
        generators: {
          script: context => {
            console.log('script', context);
            return 'ls'
          },
          postProcess: files => {
            console.log('postProcess', files);
            return [
              {
                name: 'boom',
              }
            ]
          },
        }
But I only see this in the debugger (note I'm filtering on ""SPEC LOG"" to see just logs I've made...):
I would expect to see something like...
I see the same thing in the terminal output where I'm running npm run dev, as well: just the first argument.
I've also noticed that every SPEC LOG seems to be a console.warn', and so I tried console.errorjust to see what would happen, and it came out as awarn` as well.
I do see some fig logs that appear to be string - object much like I'm trying to do; it seems this is possible but not from a spec.

Fig does not work well with the terminal tab of PhpStorm.

Stop Fig and re open the PhpStorm windows is enough to solve the issue temporally.

Attempted Resolution:
Pressing Re-run Install Script, which I am prompted to do under the debugger, but which seemingly does nothing.
Restarting my Terminal, as well as restarting my computer.
Reinstalling the application, as well as installing fig via brew install fig.
I will additionally note that the documentation here recommends running:

However, I noticed that this file is not present in my local ~/.fig directory.

fig stopped connecting to terminals, possibly upon a reboot of this machine. I noticed it wasn't running and restarted it and was walked through what looked like a reinstall, including retrieving a new six digit code emailed to me. It is running, and none of the ""Integrations"" are disabled in the settings. It thinks it is missing a socket?

As part if that, I migrated some config files from my old machine, including my ssh config. I have had Fig on that machine for quite a while and never uninstalled it there, so I still had the legacy ssh integration in my ssh config, but that configuration was no longer supported, leading to the original invalid argument warning with Fig enabled and the “not a command” error without it.
After removing the integration from my ssh config all is well and Fig is reinstalled. It’s probably a fringe case, but if it’s worth the effort, one thing that would have prevented it would be to check for that integration on installation, so it would have been caught when I installed Fig on my new machine.

Right after the macOS 12.3.0 update Fig stopped working from startup.
Each time I open a new terminal I get an error saying that the command fig is not found and, of course, fig autocomplete doesn't work.
/Users/xaer/.zshrc:127: command not found: fig
I tried every step from the common issues on the support page.
I also tried Uninstalling fig and fresh installing it with the default settings
Last thing I tried is edit the ~/.zshrc file manually adding ~/.fig/bin and ~/.local/bin to the path using:
export PATH=$PATH:~/.fig/bin
But nothing did work. I was able to run fig doctor and fig issue directly using the fig file installation on my terminal (iTerm2): ~/.fig/bin/fig doctor and ~/.fig/bin/fig issue
Output for where fig:
where fig
fig not found
If needed I can also provide my ~/.zshrc file content.
Before the update fig was running just fine, I don't know if the things are related.
Thanks for helping me!

1139,1139,Cache generator results until next run (instead of TTL),"Different from the current cache implementation. Currently, results are cached until a certain number of milliseconds has lapsed.
The proposal is to instead cache the generated suggestions, and the next time the generator runs, display the old suggestions first before replacing them with the new suggestions.
This would improve the perceived performance of git aliases, npm scripts, deno tasks, etc. It helps in cases where the results may, but are unlikely to, change between executions.
(I think there's another issue for this? Couldn't find it)
{
  generators: {
    cache: {
      untilNextRun: true,
    },
    // ...
  },
}
This could be either compatible or incompatible with ttl depending on how hard it would be to do.
When used with ttl, the previous run's suggestions could be shown on the next run unless the TTL has elapsed, in which case the suggestions would be generated again.
When used with cacheByDirectory: true, suggestions would only be shown on the next run if in the same directory.",No Fig Diagnostic Found,"['codebase:autocomplete-app', 'type:feature-request']","Mar 20, 2022, 9:29 PM PDT"
1140,1140,Fig doesn't work with multiple user accounts,"I use my laptop with multiple user accounts (personal, work, guest, sandbox, etc) and i initially installed fig in my personal account. I quite liked it so I decided to also use it in my work account. I double clicked fig and went through the setup. Everything seemed to go well, but the autocomplete did not run in the terminal. Trying to run fig from the terminal from my work account returns a: ""Could not launch fig"" message. Even executing it directly: /Applications/Fig.app/Contents/MacOS/fig-darwin-universal does not work anymore, in any of my accounts. Another thing I noticed is that once I opened fig in my work account (with fig already installed in my system, from my personal account) was that it asked me to update fig (even though it was already up to date) and it downloaded an update.

1163,1163,Custom prompt prevents autocomplete from working,"Description:
This is a really weird issue. fig does not work on terminal launch, here's the fig doctor output, sorry for all the doctor commands buts its important to explain my findings.
After the third doctor command below, fig starts to work as expected. The difference is that the third fig doctor is being run as sudo and even though the command says that Running doctor as root is not supported. that seems to be inconsequential, as when I go on to run the subsequent command sudo fig doctor --verbose the autocomplete feature starts to work (it will suggest the --verbose flag itself, and I also tested with cd and others)
After a few minutes, again it will stop working, and if you run any sudo fig command, it will start working as expected, and the pattern repeats.
NOTES:
The sequence of the sudo command doesn't matter, i.e. it doesn't need to be the third command.
The command doesn't need to be a doctor command, it can for example be this: sudo fig update and it will have the same behaviour as above. BTW the output of the update command is: Unable to Connect to Fig: Fig might not be running to launch Fig run: fig launch
Clearning the screen ($ clear or Ctrl + L) also seems to make fig stop working
After typing all of this I also discovered that maybe sudo doesn't even matter, because a command like this dasda fig upadsada (yes the typo is on purpose) also results in the same behaviour as described above.

Description:
Using iTerm 2 + Fish shell & OMF. Fig seems to break something related to tmux.
We're using https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind to manage multiple processes in tmux sessions. But when trying to start it with Fig installed, it seems like the processes do not end up running. Screenshot below:
Vs running without Fig:
Do note that this breaks with Fig even installed. Disabling all integrations and/or quitting Fig makes this problem persists. Only after uninstalling I was able to get this up and running again

Hello, today i got a notificatino from MacOS stating my disk was full. This was weird since I have little to no files. I diagnosed the problem and eventually pointed out a log file from the .fig directory. There was a 500+ gigabyte log file called ""figterm_dev_ttys001.log""

I dont have a screenshot of the file since I deleted it but here is a terminal screenshot of the du command.
I suppose this is a bug in a new version of Fig since I recently updated it.

Issue Details
Description:
Fig does a great job at figuring out what cli is being used for the most part, but there are times where it doesn't detect the correct one. One such case is for the task cli - which fig assumes is https://taskwarrior.org which in practice I'm using https://taskfile.dev. Each has very different usages, and thus different arguments - so the suggestions that fig makes don't make any sense to me.
I think an ideal solution would be to detect the command (and cache it probably, but I'm getting ahead of myself) using something like task --help and try to match it to the known one. Alternatively, let the user disable/override which suggestions are shown for each command.
For now, this is very annoying, but I didn't find a way to disable fig for just task in my case. If this is possible please let me know and I'll edit the issue as well.

When I attempt to load the PowerShell extension on macOS it says ""Loading PowerShell extension is taking longer than expected"" and will eventually time out. I uninstalled Fig and it immediately worked. Tried this on multiple machines and can reproduce the issue. If Fig is installed, VSCode's PowerShell Extension won't run. If Fig's removed, it works. No issues found in Fig Doctor.
Seems to cause the issue even when VSCode integration is disabled from inside of Fig. Can replicate the issue on 2 different machines. Install Powershell, VSCode, Fig from Brew. Try running the Powershell extension in VS Code and it fails. Uninstall Fig, restart VSCode, it works.
Running the latest version of macOS, VSCode, Powershell, Fig, etc. I've only tried it on M1 Mac's, not sure if that really would matter though.
Screen Recordings
This is a screen recording showing the Powershell Extension never loading. This is with Fig installed.

Hello,
my bash_profile is sourcing different scripts. I wrote a check before sourcing to prevent it from sourcing scripts with errors.
So this check is saying:
Failed at /Users/cegin/.bash_profile >> 1565: tty
Which is strange because my bash_profile only has 1180 lines. The last lines are:
Fig post block. Keep at the bottom of this file.
eval ""$(fig init bash post)""
The missing 390 lines are comming from your script. So I looked in your script coming from the command ""fig init bash post"" and on line 390 there is ""export TTY=$(tty)"" which is matching my error.
I think something like
export TTY=
(tty2>/dev/null||echo""/dev/tty
(w -h|grep $USER|tail -1|awk '{print $2}')"" )
could fix it...
But I didn't had the time to test it.

Issue Details
Description:
When you open the desktop app, it opens a terminal window. I had no idea fig was not a standalone app so I thought this we a weird mistake and closed the window. Since ""nothing happened"" when I opened fig, I tried to open it again. Nothing happened (it didn't even open a new terminal window this time).
Decided that something must be wrong with the standalone app so I decided to remove it and reinstall via brew MacOS told me the app was still running and couldn't be removed. Eventually, I figured out that I had to open a new terminal window on my own to , and then took a wild guess to find fig quit on the command line (it's not in the -h) to kill the daemon and allow me to delete the app (I have about 30 little icons across the top of my screen so totally missed that there might have been a new one from Fig ... a little onboarding tour at first-launch might help there).
You also messed with my .bashrc and .bash_profile without even informing me. Serious bad form.

1240,1240,Proposal: Add blank metadata field to Fig.Subcommand,"The Fig schema is fantastic for quickly writing a CLI skeleton. Currently, it is only written to model an existing CLI's behavior. There are no current libraries to use the schema as the source of truth for parsing -- I am experimenting with this in my own time, more people doing this would be welcome!
Such a framework may want to implement a subset of Fig's functionality and schema, maybe supporting parserDirectives isn't important for the framework.
It's not currently possible to do this, since you will (at some point) need to hook up the subcommand to a function that gets run.
I'm proposing metadata, an intentionally empty field that Fig doesn't use at all. It exists purely to be overridden by libraries re-using the Fig spec structure.
I think it should be roughly like this:
interface Subcommand {
  /**
   * Blank field to allow CLI frameworks to implement a subset of the Fig CLI structure.
   */
  metadata?: any;
}
The CLI framework can then provide more specific types.
export interface Subcommand {
  name: string;

I first have to take an extra step to trigger the popup by typing in a command and pressing ’spacebar’.

While they are both related to history, the fuzzy search and command history features have different use cases.
You could even consider an opt-in feature that shows the history popup when you press the ‘up’ arrow (when the main autocomplete Fig popup is not open).

conf.d scripts by third-parties should not modify fish_user_paths for common directories like ~/.local/bin. I know that fig init fish pre is also modifying fish_user_paths (twice). Since you’re aiming for Fish 3.1 or later, it is better to use fish_add_path, which can be called as fish_add_path --append $HOME/.local/bin $HOME/.fig/bin rather than the contains test you’re doing now, as it defaults to not moving values.
For 00_fig_pre.fish it’s better to do something like set -la PATH $HOME/.local/bin. This will temporarily modify $PATH during the execution period of 00_fig_pre.fish without making permanent changes.
Instead of calling eval, pipe to source: fig init fish pre | string split0 | source. For 99_fig_post.fish, the command would be fig init fish post | string split0 | source.
The comment is not useful, as this is the only thing that should be in 00_fig_pre.fish and/or 99_fig_post.fish.

Issue Details
After using Fig for a while it will eventually fully crash my MacBook. This happens quite often so that I have to fully stop using Fig. It's pretty hard to give some details but the behaviour is like:
Type a command.
Fig tries to do something, then CPU usage will somewhat ramp up.
MacBook becomes unresponsive.
MacBook eventually turns black and restarts.
Occasionally the terminal spits out something like ""too many open files"" and crashes afterwards. Maybe this helps.

I was able to fix this by running fig logout in the terminal, but this flow should be improved.

Does Fig provide a CHANGELOG record?
For context, I got a message in my terminal to say Fig was auto-updating to the latest version (1.0.56 (B434)) but I have no idea what was included in that version.

Hi, today out of the sudden fig stopped working. No autocompletion in the terminal. I also can not start the application so that it is shown in the menu bar. Very weird. But running fig doctor, tells me that everything is fine.
Anybody else having similar issues?

Hi, pretty much what's in the title.
If I type for example

I see for a split second that autocomplete tries to work, but it disappears instantly.

Running fig doctor didn't help. I tried updating fig, restarting it and rebooting my machine, none of which helped.

Issue Details
Description:
Kitty will inject its shell integration, which includes many features like only confirming before closing the window if some tabs have a running process. Their how-it-works is described here. Now after installing fig, kitty’s shell integration fails.
Some quick ways to see if kitty shell integration is working: if using default kitty conf, the cursor should change from block to bar, and clicking on the close window button right after launch will exit without confirmation (""There is one window…"")
Fig doctor reports everything is fine, and so is the Debugger. (Because fig itself runs fine)
Don't know if it is useful, but I have tried some combinations of commenting fig lines in .zprofile and .zshrc with the following results. (All debugger and diagnostics are produces without changing the rcfiles)

Previously what worked was a reinstall of fig, this did not work this time. I'm taking a wild guess that maybe its an issue with my version of MacOS I'm running? I haven't tried updating my Mac or reverting to non-beta yet but I will shortly and report back if that worked.
Things I have tried:
Uninstalling and reinstalling fig
Moving to the beta version of fig
Ensured that all open instances of terminal that were opened before installing fig were closed. Reopened terminal after installing fig.
Trying to follow instructions in the issues linked below (I did not end up having a ~/.fig/insertion-lock in my .fig folder)

Issue Details
Description:
After upgrading fig with homebrew brew upgrade --greedy, it behaves like it would be a completely new installation (I assume it is and the brew formulae wipes everything off and reinstalls fig). So users need to:
Sign in and activate fig
Enable accessibility settings in System Preferences
Go through setup
every single time they update fig.

Issue Details
As discussed via mail with Brendan, I don't know why but figs slows my imac 4,2ghz/8cores/64RAM and my macbook pro 2.8/8core/16RAM down a lot.
typing into iterm becomes slow, sloppy, slightly unresponsive, and also the whole system becomes slow.
this happens on both my macs.
I cleaned .zshrc from any fig-related strings, closed fig.app, and they suddenly woke back up, iterm is super-responsive again.
in my iterm, I use ohmyzsh+powerlevel10k (but currently it's not the theme I am using)
I also constantly run ObjectiveSee tools BlockBlock and Lulu.
Other tools: AltTab, Magnet
I haven't seen any ram over-use
Also, I just noticed that 'fig diagnostic' reports BASH as being my env shell, while if I type 'env' I get this result:

After running fig doctor I have this.
Worth to point out that Im using Visual Studio Code Insiders and fig works there. (Im assuming its looking for regular VSCode, not finding it and displays this msg.)
Also worth a note is that fig works in terminals, im getting popup window with commands etc.

Very new to Fig after I installed it everything seemed fine when I ran the fig doctor these errors came up so i ran the 'fig install --dotfiles' and it did nothing. tried changing directories and running the --dotfiles still did nothing.
Opened my ~/.zshrc file hoping to see this.
but instead got this and it's just constantly adding and modifying so when I edit and save the file it's already begun modifying itself again.
when i restart and open a new terminal these are the errors i get.
despite the fact that file is in the shell folder.
I've tried completely uninstalling fig deleting all files related to it and starting again and it just does the same thing.

I have run fig doctor in the affected terminal session
I have typed 'git ' and included a screenshot of the Debugger (click the Fig icon in the macOS menu bar)
Issue Details
Description:
Any time I start my terminal or type any command, I get an error 'fig_precmd:1: permission denied:' followed by a file path to a pCloud folder on my computer. Fig doctor says everything is fine, as does the debugger on the menu bar. If I try to autocomplete that folder it says:
(eval):4: permission denied: /Users/tbtriggs/pCloud Local (eval):8: permission denied: /Users/tbtriggs/pCloud Local (eval):9: permission denied: /Users/tbtriggs/pCloud Local (eval):10: permission denied: /Users/tbtriggs/pCloud Local
Otherwise, everything seems to be working ok. But just can't figure out what that error is or remove it.

1405,1405,Allow skipping of .*rc modification,"Sanity checks
I have searched github.com/withfig/fig/issues and there are no duplicates of my feature
Feature Details
Description:
I use a common .zshrc across multiple machines. With that said, I conditionally load fig depending on if it's installed. It would be nice if there was a configuration that could instruct fig not to modify any .*rc files; via doctor, install, etc. Without this, fig will inject configurations where I don't want them.
Also, when setting up a new machine, if this flag is implemented, it would be nice to be able to pass this to the installer. For example, when I brew install fig I would like to pass a command line argument that would skip modification.
Thanks! Love fig!

Issue Details
Description:
I'm on macOS Monterey 12.3.1. When Fig is toggled on in Privacy > Accessibility, some operations in other apps will crash the computer. These operations include:
Open PDF in VS Code
Open PDF in Edge
Close figure window in MATLAB
When the accessibility is turned off, all these operations will not cause crashes.
This problem has bothered me for a long time since I had no clue it has something to do with Fig. Until one day I saw this post. Then I tested these operations with Fig accessibility on and off, and found the issue.

Issue Details
Description:
My ~/.zshrc has the pre/post integration scripts sourced, and they are indeed the first/last things to be executed but not in the way that fig doctor presumes they would be.
For example, I prefer to not straight up source a script in my shell configuration because the file being sourced might not exist. Just sourcing files can cause problems when I move my shell configuration between machines.
To avoid this issue I prefer to wrap any source operations in an if statement like so:
if test -f ""$HOME/.fig/shell/zshrc.pre.zsh""; then
  . ""$HOME/.fig/shell/zshrc.pre.zsh""
fi
But fig doctor doesn't recognise this, and because I also like to have some comments at the top of my shell configuration that explains the file structure this may also be confusing fig doctor into thinking the sourcing isn't the first thing to happen (even though in practice, it is the first thing to be sourced).
The following snippet demonstrates what fig doctor automatically does to my shell configuration (which is annoying because it does this automatically without asking to confirm with me: Attempting to fix automatically...). Notice it actually locates the source line and moves it up out of my if statement.
# Fig pre block. Keep at the top of this file.
. ""$HOME/.fig/shell/zshrc.pre.zsh""
# NOTE:
# additional configuration of the shell is handled by ~/.inputrc which

Issue Details
Fig is storing a bunch of data in ~/.fig which does not belong there. macOS has standard locations for data.
If there's a really important reason to not follow the conventions, some apps compromise by storing data in ~/.config

I use zinit to manage my CLI plugins, one of my plugins is zsh-autosuggestions check the following .zshrc config:
# Zsh plugins

## autocompletion & autosuggestions
zi wait lucid light-mode atload'_zsh_autosuggest_start' for \
    zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
# ...
This command wait for 0s -to speed up terminal loading- then load zsh-autosuggestions and then call _zsh_autosuggest_start function.
This procedure cause issue with fig autocomplete menu, where it's not showed up unless I start a new line with pressing Enter. If I disable the plugin fig works fine, also if I use the normal loading (without waiting) fig works fine.
zi light zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
I tried to increase the waiting time zi wait'5' .. fig works fine until the plugin is loaded, then only plugin auto complete shows and fig menu stop showing.

1482,1482,Fig sometimes ignores aliases within autocomplete,"Description:
I have a few aliases for git operations that seem to trip up fig's autocomplete but only sometimes 🤔
Example:
git co is an alias for git checkout
git br is an alias for git branch
Typing git co <start of branch name here> fig seems to get hung up on trying to autocomplete to git commit instead. Typing git br fig will try to autocomplete to git branch.
This mainly prevents fig from working to autocomplete other values later (e.g. branch names for the above examples), and I usually need to hit Esc to prevent fig from attempting to insert the commit or branch parts of the command.
I'm not sure I know why, but sometimes this isn't an issue and fig properly understands these custom aliases.

Issue Details
Description:
Just starting with fig.
It sometimes, and inconsistently, autocompletes for me.
I don't want that, ever
I definitely do not want it to be unpredictable.
Example (see video): I type ""gs"". g is an alias for git, s is a git alias for ""status"". For some (bad) reason, I type an extra space.
In the same session, it will sometimes list a list of files, sometime not (inconsistently)
If I simply press <return>, it adds the first choice. If I don't press <tab> or the arrow keys, I don't want fig do affect what I am doing, absolutely never, ever. I just want to press return. If it's deemed a ""feature"", is there a setting for that?

fig doctor shows this error:
● Could not read VSCode extensions in dir ~/.vscode/extensions: No such file or directory (os error 2)
however, ~/.vscode-insiders/extensions/ is present on a system running vscode insiders version.
Fig Diagnostics can't find ""Visual Studio Code' however, Visual Studio Code - Insiders exists in it's place.
I found an open issue from a few months back noting the extensions directory with regard to insiders, but found nothing regarding the integration. I think both issues could be resolved by adding the insiders specific folder and command names to fig's vscode definition(s) rather than treating *-insiders like a separate product.

I seem to be unable to change the color of my prompt outside of the default theme settings for plugins -- I tried using both pure and spaceship plugins and changing settings of various prompt colors. I tried opening new terminals each time, and also tried fig source each time, and nothing seems to change it.
Installing one of the plugins does update the prompt in general to their theme, but neither seem to be customizable by myself. I assumed it wasn't each plugins fault and something based in fig since it was an issue with both plugins for me, but I could be wrong.
I also removed everything from my .zshrc except for simple aliases.
This is a brand new install, and it works great and the plugin functionalities work great too. I have no other plugins installed at all, except for Pure or Spaceship Prompt, and never both at the same time while I was fiddling with this.
Sorry I didn't want to make an issue out of this but couldn't seem to figure out what I was missing. Forgive me again if this is the wrong spot for this report, I thought that possibly it has something to do with config of zsh in general with fig.

The autocomplete popup seems to pop up when I change the prompt ordering so the command is on the same line as the prompt and not separated by a new line, so it seems that the new line in the prompt is the issue.
However, the popup does show up if I pipe to a new command, i.e. ps aux | grep vim where the popup shows up on the grep but not on the ps.

Issue Details
Description:
When opening tmux, as well as creating a new pane, or switching to an existing pane, the pane will first display a message that appears to be related to fig (see screenshot below).
So to help debug this I removed the following line from my .tmux.conf:
source-file ~/.fig/tmux
I opened a new terminal instance (I'm using Alacritty, but the same happened with the macOS default terminal app) and the fig message disappeared. So it seems something in that fig script isn't compatible with the latest tmux release.

Issue Details
Description:
Fig autosuggestions behave inconsistently when zsh-autosuggestions is enabled. Installing zsh-autosuggestions with Fig also doesn't help. Disabling zsh-autosuggestions solves the problem. Fig doctor tells me that everything is fine.

I never shut down my Mac in the night, I noticed when I re-wake up my Mac next morning and keep focus in WebStorm, and it was not working when I type the command in the terminal, and it was not working too in iTerm2, even I reopen iTerm2. But it's working after I restart fig, I guess it is an issue.

1547,1547,Personal shortcuts don't work anymore.,"Description:
Hi.
I've been using fig for some months. For me, one of the most useful features is the Personal Shortcuts.
I've used them since day 1, but, for the last couple of weeks they have stopped working for me.
I didn't make any changes to my shortcuts file, but just incase, I've followed the instructions in: https://fig.io/docs/guides/personal-shortcuts#create-personal-shortcuts-with-fig and generated a new clean and simple shortcuts file and it does not work either.
When I'm in the Personal Shortcuts dev mode, I can see the autocomplete menu, but sometimes it just hides before I make any selection. As for compiled mode, the autocomplete menu doesn't show at all.
I made a short video:
2022-06-17_12-22-10.mp4
Also, fig doctor does not show any issues:
Any ideas?

1548,1548,Custom CSS in each theme,"I wanted to check to see if it would be possible to provide our own css styles in the themes.json file?
The issue
I have been playing around with fig to add a custom theme for my local fig window. I wanted to add some padding and eliminate box shadows but the current theme schema doesn't allow for this. It would be awesome if a css key could be added in the themes.json file that will inject a custom stylesheet in the fig window. This would also open the door for creating really dynamic fig themes. Here is an example of using custom themes (First pic: default behavior, second pic: themes with custom stylesheets)
How I am currently circumventing this problem right now
Whenever fig starts, it fetches the html document and css files from the fig servers. I am intercepting the query to get the css file and monkey patching my custom CSS on the response body
My suggestion
It should be fairly easy to support a css key in the theme.json file like so:
{
  ""author"": {
    ""name"": ""John Does"",
    ""twitter"": ""@john_doe"",
    ""github"": ""jdoe""
  },
  ""version"": ""1.0"",
  ""theme"": {
       ....existing config here for convenient theme-ing,
      ""css"": ""#foo { background: yellow; }""
  }
}
and then parsing that string during runtime and inserting it into a new <style> element after the existing stylesheet.
I would love to hear your thoughts and would be happy to contribute or add documentation for the different DOM elements in the fig window for easy reference for future theme creators",No Fig Diagnostic Found,['None yet'],"Nov 9, 2021, 9:08 AM PST"

Type cat de in iterm, zsh-autosuggestions shows bug.log in grew text while Fig shows debug.log as a file in the dropdown. Pressing right results in cat dedebug.log in the terminal.

Issue Details
Description:
I ran the dotfiles import to set up my Fig dotfiles. However, no matter what I do any blocks that were part of the original import are not enabled in any shells/os. None of my aliases work. When I click configure and tick the checkboxes, the next time I click configure they are unselected again.
Note: Manually adding new blocks seems to work ok.

So I followed the instructions and ran fig issue for the first time, which took me here. I then spent a while writing up a detailed description of the bug, before remembering that I should check whether it had already been reported first. Sure enough, it was!
What if the fig doctor output and/or the new issue template reminded users to search for an existing issue before creating a new one? I know this should be obvious, but because the output directs users to jump straight to reporting a new issue, it's easier to forget to search first. 😅

Issue Details
Description:
Explanation and details
When installing zsh-autocomplete, as standalone or using fig's Plugin Store, it completely breaks fig's autocomplete.
It seems fig's autocomplete window flashes up for an instant, but zsh-autocomplete immediately hides it when loading its own results and theres is no way to bring fig's autocomplete window again, since TAB key is already hard-mapped to zsh-autocomplete.
Observations
I think this issue should be fixed by avoiding hiding autocomplete window when new text is output in the terminal (like in this case happens with zsh-autocomplete results) or, if they are actually conflicting tools, then remove zsh-autocomplete from the plugin store.
I suspect other cli-tools with similar behaviour will also break fig's autocomplete functionality, so maybe you should take a look on how it controls its own visibility, persisting just until it receives user action, and not just hiding on terminal action.
Reproduction steps
To reproduce the issue, just open Fig's plugin store, install zsh-autocomplete, run source fig in the terminal and try to use fig autocomplete, you will quickly realize it gets broken.
Environment details
I tried both beta and regular fig versions, and several different configs.

Issue Details
When typing in terminal or iTerm2, the autocomplete appears but when I press enter the autocomplete does not fill the line.
I've seen this discussed and closed elsewhere with no fix I could find. (#617)
Environment
I recently updated to macOS 12.4 so this may be causing it.

Please include a detailed description of the issue (and an image or screen recording, if applicable)
On one of the three Macs on which I am running fig, there is what I think is a red border around the auto-complete menu (see attached screenshots). When the menu is not populated, it presents as a single vertical line. This happens in both terminal.app and the VSCode integrated terminal. I believe this happened after a recent update. I am guessing it's a config thing rather than a bug since it is only happening on one computer, and that it is related to Fig because it happens in two different programs (unless VSCode is just a window for terminal.app).
I have tried
restarting Fig
restarting the computer
renaming the ~/.fig folder
renaming the ~/Library/Preferences/com.mschrage.fig* folders
reinstalling Fig
None of these steps have resolved the problem. Any thoughts of where else to look would be appreciated.

I have searched github.com/withfig/fig/issues and there are no duplicates of my issue
I have run fig doctor in the affected terminal session
I have typed 'git ' and included a screenshot of the Debugger (click the Fig icon in the macOS menu bar)
Issue Details
Description:
When creating personal shortcuts it is recommended to add two \b characters (backspace escape code) at the start of your insertValue command to remove the shortcut trigger from the actual command. \b characters are ignored if the insertValue command is passed a template literal ``
Example
Assuming a personal shortcut triggered by +[space]
{
      icon: ""fig://icon?type=github"",
      name: ""withfig/fig issues"",
      insertValue: ""\b\bopen https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues"",
      description: ""Open Fig Issues Github page""
}
The above works as expected the + typed to trigger the shortcuts is removed and open https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues is triggered as expected.
{
      name: ""Good Morning! ☀️"",
      icon: ""☀️"",
      description: ""Update brew, NPM and node. Say an inspirational quote"",
      insertValue: `\b\b
        brew update; 
        npm install npm@latest -g; 
        npm update -g;
        brew upgrade node;
        echo;
        npx -y fortuity | npx -y cowsay;
        echo;
      `
}
The above runs but before it starts it logs a command not found: + error.
Additional Thoughts
Because new lines trigger the previous command we could see some issues with any new lines before \b\b. e.g.
insertValue: `
  \b\b;
  brew update; 
  npm install npm@latest -g; 
  npm update -g;
  brew upgrade node;
  echo;
  npx -y fortuity | npx -y cowsay;
  echo;
`
would still trigger a command not found error because the enter signal would be sent before the backspace signals. Not exactly related but close enough any solution to this should probably keep that in mind.

1620,1620,Fig defeats fish shell's Ctrl+F shortcut,"Description:
Please include a detailed description of the issue (and an image or screen recording, if applicable)
One of the most useful and frequently used keyboard shortcuts offered by all shells out-of-the-box is Ctrl+F, which is mapped to ""move cursor right"". In fish shell, this keyboard shortcut combines beautifully with fish's built-in auto-completion support to enable the user to easily accept fish's currently suggested auto-completion.[1]
However, after upgrading to the latest version of Fig, Fig has now taken over Ctrl+F in fish shell, so users can no longer use it to move the cursor right or accept fish's current auto-completion. Instead, Ctrl+F now trigger's Fig's ""Create new Workflow..."" UI. Here's a screenshot where you can see I had typed ""./u"", then fish suggested an auto-completion (""./upgrade-dev-dependencies.sh""), then I tried hitting Ctrl+F to accept that completion, but rather than working as expected, Fig instead took over my shell with its ""Create new Workflow"" UI (but somewhat confusingly, still left fish's suggested auto-completion visible):
I searched in Fig settings for any sign of a Ctrl+F keybinding I could hopefully disable, but couldn't find it there.
Could you please fix this in the next version of Fig? And in the meantime, is there any workaround to get Ctrl+F working in fish again with the current version of Fig? This bug is killing my productivity so much I might have to uninstall Fig until this is fixed, but I'm hoping it won't come to that.
Thanks for the great work on Fig!
[1] You can also use right arrow, but Ctrl+F is preferable for touch typists because there's no need to take hands away from the home row, especially when the Control key is in a convenient place, e.g. when Capslock is mapped to Control.
